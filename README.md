# Event Manager

## Exercise

This is a tutorial from The Odin Project's Ruby on Rails path. In this tutorial, you will learn to assist a non-profit organization focused on political activism. Your task is to engage event attendees by finding their government representatives based on zip codes.

## What I've Learned

Throughout this tutorial, I've gained knowledge and skills in:

- Manipulating file input and output.
- Reading and processing data from a CSV file.
- Transforming CSV data into a standardized format.
- Utilizing data to interact with a remote service.
- Populating templates with user data.
- Mastering string manipulation techniques.
- Accessing Google's Civic Information API using the Google API Client Gem.
- Creating dynamic templates using ERB (Embedded Ruby).

Completing this tutorial has provided me with a solid foundation for handling real-world data scenarios.
